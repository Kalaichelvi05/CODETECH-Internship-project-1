    <img src="swarm.jpg" alt="Cert 3">
    <h4>National Seminar</h4>
    <p>“Attended a national seminar on emerging technologies featuring Swarm Intelligence. Explored how decentralized, self‑organizing systems—modeled on ant, bee, and bird behaviors—solve real-world challenges via AI-driven coordination without central control. Learned about applications ranging from swarm robotics and optimization algorithms (like PSO and ACO) to smart logistics, environmental monitoring, and network routing. Gained insight into how collective intelligence enhances efficiency, scalability, and resilience in modern tech landscapes.”</p>

    <img src="php.jpg" alt="Cert 4">
    <h4>Workshop certificate</h4>
    <p>“Attended a hands-on workshop on Women’s Security using SMS Alert built with PHP. Learned how to design and implement a web‑based safety system enabling users to register emergency contacts and trigger real‑time SMS alerts—including GPS location when applicable—to trusted contacts during critical situations. Covered integration with SMS gateways (e.g. TextLocal), backend PHP logic, and frontend form handling to create a responsive SOS alert functionality.”</p>
  </div>
  <div class="cert-box">
    <img src="cyber.jpg" alt="Cert 5">
    <h4>Deloitte certificate</h4>
    <p>“Completed the Deloitte Cyber Job Simulation as part of Deloitte’s Virtual Internship (Cybertrack), hosted on the Forage platform. In this self‑paced simulation, I played the role of a cybersecurity analyst investigating a simulated data breach—analyzing web activity logs, detecting automated suspicious behavior, and identifying internal threat patterns. Through log analysis, anomaly detection, and incident response strategies, I practiced real-world cyber defense workflows and earned a certificate of completion.”</p>
